# Front End Course

This was the [final project](https://joonanykanen.github.io/responsive_sass_website/) I created and modified when learning Sass.

Initially I learned by watching a series of tutorials on Youtube called
[Responsive Portfolio Website](https://youtu.be/gYzHS-n2gqU) which I highly recommend.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you started on the project.

### Installing

In order to get the files on your local hard drive, I recommend using git

    git clone https://github.com/joonanykanen/responsive_sass_website

### Running the website locally

You should run [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) -plugin on VS Code in order to get the website running.

Also this project needs [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) additionally for code changes.

To start the sass monitoring script, run

    npm run sass
